# Projects ideas for software engineering students

This readme file lists some proposal for personal projects that can be made by students to deep dive into many technical stacks.

## Outputs

Projects must be pushed to public Git repositories. Project's content:

- Source Code
- Documentation files, including 
    - project description
    - design schemas and diagrams
    - user guideline
- Tests reports and code quality
- Insfrastucture code such as Dockerfiles, Kubernetes Resources, Terraform scripts, etc..
